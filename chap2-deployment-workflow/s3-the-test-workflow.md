# The test workflow
The test workflow is designed to maintain the integrity and reliability of our service by automatically running a suite of unit/integration tests. These tests are triggered whenever a Pull Request (PR) is created or merged. This ensures that any new code contributions or changes to the existing codebase do not disrupt the functionality of the service.
